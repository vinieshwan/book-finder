# Book finder App Client
Handles the UI/UX of the app which currently contains 2 pages. One is the home page and the other one is the search result page.

_Note: This can be run independently though search result page will just display with loading if the API is not up._

To run independently just type the following command:
```sh
    $ yarn start
```


## Homepage
 - Displays the typical information of a website or app that you would want to highlight.

## Search result page
 - Displays the searched book information details by ISBN.
